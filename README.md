<!-- It is good practice to add an about or summary -->
## About

For this assignment I used one of the example provide in the assignment. I chose the poster avobe because its clear grid design that let me explore more the attribute of flex on css and have a better understanding how to manipulate it in to a responsive design. In this assignment I explored for the first timeanimation
on css and some functions in javascript.
<!-- It is essential to describe how to set up your project -->
## Setup
For redesign a poster you can setup using: 


<!-- Any knowledge or tools you will need before hand -->
### Prerequisites

To make a good readme the following prerequisites are necessary:
1. A design software program - In this project I used [Figma](https://figma.com/)
2. A text editor - like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Terminal or Command line to follow up your website updates with localhost.

<!-- any installation needs should be defined -->
### Installation

To use your terminal or command line to locally host your website (in case of Mac):
1. Open Terminal 
2. Type <code>cd</code> (donâ€™t forget the space)
3. In Finder, navigate to the folder and  Drag and drop into the Terminal.
4. In Terminal, type: <code>browser-sync start --server -f -w</code>
5. Server should launch, and you should see the correct ip address to navigate to.
   Something like this: localhost:3000

**Notes: There a other ways to open a localhost. This is just my prefer method, because automatically refresh the website.**

### Develop

To develop this project, you can:
1. Sketch and Design website
2. Develop code into your code editor
3. Follow progress in your localhost

**Note: Instead of a code editor, you can use [Glitch](https://glitch.com) to keep track of your code in real-time.

<!-- Notes about the deployment -->
### Deployment

For a project in progress it is possible to host it on [Glitch](https://glitch.com)

# Notes & Process
For this assignment I decided to use one or the design suggested in the assignment post.

The clear hierarchy and grid, helps me to understand better the process to understand better about layout organization. For the redesign exercise, I started from creating a Style Guide of the swiss poster:

**Style guide of Swiss Poster**

Altough I tried to exacly find  the font used in this poster. I wasn't able to get with  a precise answer. I made a little bit of research trying to figure it out the type font. but the shape of the **G** didn't match with any swiss type style that i looked for. The close it fonts are the Helvetiva and Univers. However this small deep in to typograghy helps me to better know about swiss typography styles.

## Process & Documentation

**Sketching**
Sketch helps me to rapidly obser the layout of the poster and how approach the redesign to website.
