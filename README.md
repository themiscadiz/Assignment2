<!-- It is good practice to add an about or summary -->
## About

For this assignment I used one of the example provide in the assignment. I chose the poster avobe because its clear grid design that let me explore more the attribute of flex on css and have a better understanding how to manipulate it in to a responsive design. In this assignment I explored for the first timeanimation
on css and some functions in javascript.

<!-- It is essential to describe how to set up your project -->
## Setup
For redesign a poster you can setup using: 


<!-- Any knowledge or tools you will need before hand -->
### Prerequisites

To make a good readme the following prerequisites are necessary:
1. A design software program - In this project I used [Figma](https://figma.com/)
2. A text editor - like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Terminal or Command line to follow up your website updates with localhost.

<!-- any installation needs should be defined -->
### Installation

To use your terminal or command line to locally host your website (in case of Mac):
1. Open Terminal 
2. Type <code>cd</code> (donâ€™t forget the space)
3. In Finder, navigate to the folder and  Drag and drop into the Terminal.
4. In Terminal, type: <code>browser-sync start --server -f -w</code>
5. Server should launch, and you should see the correct ip address to navigate to.
   Something like this: localhost:3000

**Notes: There a other ways to open a localhost. This is just my prefer method, because automatically refresh the website.**

<!-- Write instructions on how to start working on your project -->
### Develop

To develop this project, you can:
1. Sketch and Design website
2. Develop code into your code editor
3. Follow progress in your localhost

**Note: Instead of a code editor, you can use [Glitch](https://glitch.com) to keep track of your code in real-time.

<!-- Notes about the deployment -->
### Deployment

For a project in progress it is possible to host it on [Glitch](https://glitch.com)

# Notes & Process
For this assignment I decided to use one or the design suggested in the assignment post.

The clear hierarchy and grid, helps me to understand better the process to understand better about layout organization. For the redesign exercise, I started from creating a Style Guide of the swiss poster:

**Website about New York**
In the theme of new york I decided to work in this assignmentr with Loisaida. It is was was call for newyoricans the Lower East Side neiborghood. This neighborhood has a rich history of social activism for the newyorican community, specially in the 60's, 70's and 80's. In this redesign website web document that remembrance their participants and its contrubution.

**Style guide of Swiss Poster**

Altough I tried to exacly find  the font used in this poster. I wasn't able to get with  a precise answer. I made a little bit of research trying to figure it out the type font. but the shape of the **G** didn't match with any swiss type style that i looked for. The close it fonts are the Helvetiva and Univers. However this small deep in to typograghy helps me to better know about swiss typography styles.

## Process & Documentation

**Sketching**
Sketch helps me to rapidly obser the layout of the poster and how approach the redesign to website.

**Wireframes**  
This step help me to part from the style guide of the poster to a make grid decision about the new redesign. For the wireframe and other design decision I used Figma. Altough was the first time using this software, it was friendly to understand and follow.

**Design specifications**
For a more detail design specification I made a style guide with new design.

**Html and css**
To have a fast feedback about the html and css development I used Glitch. For better understanding of the developers practice I started my code from las class live code example. Although through the process I made a lot of modifications, this first approach helps me as a guide line in the html and css practices.

In this sequence of images you can see the process from the first html modification to the style of the layout. This part took me a lot of effor to be able to understand a little bit better how to work with grisd and responsive layouts.

The main two columns on the website change into one column, one row design. 
The navegation is 4 item list aside of the title "Lower East Side". In the small responsive version this navegation goes below the title.
This flow is use in the other rows section in the website.

**Animation on css**

This is my very first time that I tried in css. In a infinite loop I move the title back and foward, changing the color of the title, and breaking the layout. I had some difficulties using this feature because the movement affect the clickability of the navigation. 
At first I move the animation side to side. Although the title wasn't above the navigation. it is affect the clicability of it. I changed the animation from top to bottom, and in this case affect the navigation when use a smaller screen width. I tried different option but I didn't figure it out how to debbug it.

**Integration with javascript**
Understanding how to imprement javascript was challenging for this assigment. Altough since last semester i have use p5.js, I don't have any experience using js outside p5.
However, I was able to use to js function such as <code>onload</code>, and <code>click</code> in this website. 

   * When one of the image upload, open a window who welcome the user to the website.

   * When user mouse clicked "Loisaida" in the navegation, open a window with a definition od the word "loisaida".

Although I am not sure what it is a better practice,I started the <script> in html, I moved the function into another file.
