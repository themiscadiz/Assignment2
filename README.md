<!-- It is good practice to add an about or summary -->
## About

For this assignment I used one of the example provide in the assignment. I chose the poster avobe because its clear grid design that let me explore more the attribute of flex on css and have a better understanding how to manipulate it in to a responsive design. In this assignment I explored for the first timeanimation
on css and some functions in javascript.
<!-- It is essential to describe how to set up your project -->
## Setup
For redesign a poster you can setup using: 


<!-- Any knowledge or tools you will need before hand -->
### Prerequisites

To make a good readme the following prerequisites are necessary:
1. A design software program - In this project I used [Figma](https://figma.com/)
2. A text editor - like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Terminal or Command line to follow up your website updates with localhost.

<!-- any installation needs should be defined -->
### Installation

To use your terminal or command line to locally host your website (in case of Mac):
1. Open Terminal 
2. Type <code>cd</code> (donâ€™t forget the space)
3. In Finder, navigate to the folder and  Drag and drop into the Terminal.
4. In Terminal, type: <code>browser-sync start --server -f -w</code>
5. Server should launch, and you should see the correct ip address to navigate to.
   Something like this: localhost:3000

**Notes: There a other ways to open a localhost. This is just my prefer method, because automatically refresh the website.**
